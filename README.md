# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://www.adventofcode.com) in Java, wrapped into a [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org) project. There is a simple starter script that allows you to run the solution for a certain day and, optionally, on a certain input:
```
./aoc.sh <day> [<input>]
```
Note that <day> needs to be double-digit even when below 10 and the <input> file is expected to reside in the corresponding source folder for that day. The default input is my actual input for the given day.
